## Goal(s) for the demo:

* Work with the `substring()` method from the String class.

  * This method is overloaded. `substring(int a)` will create a substring from index until the end.

  * `substring(int , int b)` will create a substring from index *a* until, but not including index *b*.

* `indexOf(String ch)` is a method from the String class that reports the index (position) of the first occurence of the substring *ch*.
**If the substring does not exist, then the method will report -1.
