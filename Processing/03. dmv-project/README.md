# DMV Project

## What I Learned:
1. To make our stop sign (octagon) we used `beginVertex` and `endVertex` to plot points onto the canvas 
2. We can use `strokeWeight` to change the thickness of a shape or line. 

## If I had more time 
* My partner and I would have learned how to animate the car and maybe make some adjustments to the individual objects like.. the car!
