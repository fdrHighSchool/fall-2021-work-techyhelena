# First Sketch

## What I Learned:
1. The coordinates system works differently compared to how I'm used to it in math class
- Meaning the the lower you want to place your objects, the **HIGHER** your y-values.
- **ALSO** its important to remember that there are no *negatives*. 

2. `void setup` and `void draw` is necessary to allow the program to function!

## What I struggled with: 
- Centering the objects and figuring out the proper length and width for the perfume bottle.
